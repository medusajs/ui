<br />

Welcome to Medusa UI, a React implementation of the Medusa design system.
It is a collection of components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes that can be used to build
a consistent user interface across the Medusa Admin and other Medusa applications.

<br />

We have also made available a Figma file containing designs for all components, as well as icons, colours and other design system tokens:

## Packages

---

Medusa UI is split into multiple packages. Each package is published to npm
and can be installed separately.

<br />

- `@medusajs/ui` - React components, hooks, and utility functions used
  in Medusa UI.
- `@medusajs/ui-preset` - Tailwind CSS preset containing all the classes
  used in Medusa UI.
- `@medusajs/icons` - Icons used in Medusa UI.

## About

---

At its core, Medusa UI is a styled and slightly opinionated implementation of [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).
We have also referenced the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for inspiration in certain implementations.

<br />
Much like our foundations, we strongly believe in keeping our components simple and
composable, allowing you to build whatever you need. We have tried to avoid overloading
the component API and, instead, leveraged the native HTML API, which gets implemented
and respected accordingly, and passed to the underlying elements.
